## TOPICS ##
--------------------------------------------------------
# Phase 1: The Foundation (Syntax & Logic)
- Target: Being able to write simple scripts and solve algorithmic problems.

    [+] Structure & Syntax: [+]
        - Solution/Project: The whole box (your application)
        - Namespace: A logical grouping like a folder or a section in a library. It prevents naming conflicts
        - Class: The specific blueprint for an object (like "Customer" or "Product")
        - Method: An action that the class can do (like "CalculateTax" or "SaveToDatabase")
        - Statement: A single ilne of instruction

        - Real World Example (E-commerce System)
            - Namespace: Amazon.Paymentsystem -> This tels us we are in the Payment section of the app
            - Class: CreditCardProcessor -> This is the specific tool we are using
            - Method: ProcessTransaction() -> This is the action happening
            - Statement: DeductMoney(100); -> The actual line of code doing the work

    [+] Variables & Data Types:
        - Core Data Types
            - int: Whole numbers. Used for counting
            - double: Numbers with decimals. Used for general math, physics, or graphics
            - decimal: High-precision decimal numbers. Crucial for money
            - string: Text
            - bool: True or false

        - Database Mapping
            - int -> SQL Database INT
            - string -> SQL Database VARCHAR
            - bool -> SQL Database BIT (0 or 1)

    [+] Control Flow:
        - Control flows is how you give your program a "brain".
        - Without it, your code is just a list of instructions that runs once from top to bottom and dies
        - Control flow allows you program to:
            - Make Decisions: If x happens, do Y (if-else, switch)
            - Repeat Actions: Do this 50 times(for, foreach, while)

    [+] Methods (Functions):
        - A method is a reusable block of code that does one specific task
        - Think of your Main method as the "Manager" of a factory. The manager shouldn't be thightening bolts or packing boxes.
        - The Manager should just shout commands: "Start Machine", "Process Order", "Shut Down"
        - Methods are those specific commands

        - The Anatomy Of A Methods:
            - Input(Parameters): What does the tool need to work
            - Logic(Body): What does the tool do
            - Output(Return Type) What does the tool give back in response

# Phase 2: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Target: Structuring code into reusable, modular blocks.

    > Classes & Objects:

    > The 4 Pillars of OOP:

    > Interfaces:

Phase 3: Intermediate C# (The Toolset)
Target: Handling data efficiently and writing cleaner code.

    > Collections (Data Structures):

    > Generics:

    > Exception Handling:

    > File I/O:

    > LINQ (Language Integrated Query): **(Crucial) **

# Phase 4: Advanced C# (Professional Level)
- Target: Writing high-performance, asynchronous code (Essential for backend/trading bots).

    > Asynchronous Programming: **(Most Important) **

    > Delegates & Events:

    > Advanced OOP:

    > Reflection & Attributes:
